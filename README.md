
## Pretty Markup: Write HTML Like Poetry (But for the Web!)

Imagine crafting elegant, semantic HTML structures without the clutter of angle brackets. Pretty Markup, a revolutionary preprocessor like Sass for CSS or TypeScript for JavaScript, Pretty Markup takes HTML to the next level.

**But how?**

* **Goodbye `< >`, Hello Readability:** Pretty Markup reimagines HTML syntax, potentially using a more natural language-like approach. This could make writing HTML a breeze, boosting developer productivity.
* **Semantic Powerhouse:**  Focus on the meaning of your content, not just its presentation. Pretty Markup encourage semantic best practices, ensuring your HTML is not only beautiful but also machine-readable.
* **A Superset of HTML?**  Think of it as a layer on top of regular HTML. Write clean, concise code in Pretty Markup, and it seamlessly translates into standard, browser-compatible HTML under the hood. It represents a potential future where writing HTML is an expressive and enjoyable experience.
